# Burrow

## Description

This repo is a fork from the linkedin project. It analyses and exposes metrics
over http. Then a custom datadog check is consuming it an produces `burrow.*`
metrics.

As it's just a fork turned into a gygservice, if you want to know more about how
it works, please read the readme or [developers documentation](https://github.com/linkedin/Burrow/wiki).
