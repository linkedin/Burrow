// Core Burrow logic.
// The core package is where all the internal logic for Burrow is located. It provides several helpers for setting up
// logging and application management (such as PID files), as well as the Start method that runs Burrow itself.
//
// The documentation for the rest of the internals, including all the available modules, is available at
// https://godoc.org/github.com/linkedin/Burrow/core/internal/?m=all. For the most part, end users of Burrow should not
// need to refer to this documentation, as it is targeted at developers of Burrow modules. Details on what modules are
// available and how to configure them are available at https://github.com/linkedin/Burrow/wiki
