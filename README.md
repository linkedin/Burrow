# Burrow - Kafka Consumer Lag Checking

Burrow is a monitoring companion for [Apache Kafka](http://kafka.apache.org) that provides consumer lag checking as a service without the need for specifying thresholds. It monitors committed offsets for all consumers and calculates the status of those consumers on demand. An HTTP endpoint is provided to request status on demand, as well as provide other Kafka cluster information. There are also configurable notifiers that can send status out via email or HTTP calls to another service.

## Features
* NO THRESHOLDS! Groups are evaluated over a sliding window.
* Multiple Kafka Cluster support
* Automatically monitors all consumers using Kafka-committed offsets
* Configurable support for Zookeeper-committed offsets
* Configurable support for Storm-committed offsets
* HTTP endpoint for consumer group status, as well as broker and consumer information
* Configurable emailer for sending alerts for specific groups
* Configurable HTTP client for sending alerts to another system for all groups

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
Burrow is written in Go, so before you get started, you should [install and set up Go](https://golang.org/doc/install).

If you have not yet installed [Dep](https://github.com/golang/dep), please go over there and follow their short installation instructions. Dep is used to automatically pull in the dependencies for Burrow so you don't have to chase them all down.

### Build and Install
```
$ go get github.com/linkedin/Burrow
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/linkedin/Burrow
$ dep ensure
$ go install
```

### Running Burrow
```
$ $GOPATH/bin/Burrow --config path/to/burrow.cfg
```

### Using Docker
A Docker file is available which builds this project on top of an Alpine Linux image.
To use it, build your docker container, mount your Burrow configuration into `/etc/burrow` and run docker.

A [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) is also available for quick and easy development.

Install Docker Compose and then:

1. Build the docker container:
   ```
   docker-compose build
   ```

2. Run the docker compose stack which includes kafka and zookeeper:
   ```
   docker-compose down; docker-compose up
   ```

3. Some test topics have already been created by default and Burrow can be accessed on port 8000 of your docker-machine. e.g. `http://192.168.99.100:8000/v2/kafka`

### Configuration
